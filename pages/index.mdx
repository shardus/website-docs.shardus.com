# Shardus
<a href="https://www.shardus.com" className="text-red-500 no-underline hover:underline">**Shardus**</a> is building distributed ledger software to remedy the problems of traditional blockchains â€” **scalability**, **decentralization** and **efficiency**. The technology being developed will use **compute** and **state sharding** to accommodate **billions** of daily active users, allowing for **global-scale decentralized networks**.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€" type="error">
  This documentation will enable you to build **scaleable** apps that users around the world can **host** and interact with. We can't wait to see what you build with our **_state of the art blockchain technology_**.
</Callout>

## Shardeum

Shardus is the software behind [Shardeum](https://shardeum.org/), a sharded EVM based smart contract platform.

## Technology

All peer-to-peer networks built using Shardus will benefit from sharding and auto-scaling to provide high throughput, low latency, and immediate finality while maintaining the highest level of decentralization and security.

The supporting technology that allows for these features is our unique Shardus Consensus Algorithm, which is based on Proof-of-Quorum, in combination with the Shardus Distributed Ledger, which addresses the problems of linear scaling and state sharding as the network grows.

## Get Started

Whether you're building a full-fledged decentralized application, or just want to get an idea of what's possible with Shardus, the links in this section will help you get going.

## Quickstart

Shardus has been designed from the ground up to make decentralized app
development as painless as possible. The fastest way to see how Shardus does
this is to jump right in and try it with the five minute [quickstartguide](/docs/quickstart).

## Application Demo

Another great way to start building applications with Shardus is to use an
existing application demo(s) as template. A list of demo application to use as templates can be found on
the Shardus Gitlab page [here](https://gitlab.com/shardus/applications).
