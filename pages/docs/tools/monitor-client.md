# Monitor Client

The monitor client is useful for monitoring the state of a running Shardus network at a glance. Each of the colored circles surrounding the perimeter of the large circle represents a node. There are 3 colors for representing a node's status:

---

- `green` indicates that the node is active and validating transactions in the network.

- `yellow` indicates that a node is syncing with the network.

- `grey` indicates that a node has submitted a join request and is waiting for its request to be accepted, so it can start the syncing process.

   Hovering over a node will reveal a list of properties that are held by each node:

  `nodeId` indicates that node's ID

  `marker` indicates the cycle marker seen by that node

  `state` indicates the hash value for the color of a node's state (this is green if everything looks OK and red otherwise)

  `nodeList` indicates the hash of the node list of this node

  `ExtIp` displays the node's IP address

  `ExtPort` displays the node's port

  `TxInjected` indicates the current rate of injected transactions seen by this node

  `TxApplied` indicates the current rate of applied transactions seen by this node

  `TxRejected` indicates the current rate of rejected transactions seen by this node

  `TxExpired` indicates the current rate of expired transactions seen by this node

In the top right corner of the monitor client, you can see stats for the overall network performance of your application.
