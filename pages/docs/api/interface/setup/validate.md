# validate

Shardus expects a function called `validate` to be passed into `setup`. This
function is provided with the transaction as an argument passed into the
function.

This function needs to return an object with the following properties: `{
result, reason }`. `result` should be a boolean, `reason` should be
a string with a descriptive reason for why the result passed or failed.

The purpose of this function is to add an extra validation checkpoint for the
fields passed into the transaction. It should check to make sure all the
correct data types are passed into the specific type of transaction that's
about to be processed. Basically, it's just to make sure nothing was passed in
as the wrong data type, or that certain fields that need to exist on objects
do exist, and with the correct primitive types. You don't need to worry about
this function too much for development purposes, it's just an extra precaution
for the most part.

> `validate` is where most of the the critical validation happens. But it's
> never a bad idea to type check before passing it along to `validate`. The

> Here's an example of how `validate` was implemented for a messaging application:

```javascript
validate(tx) {

  let result = "pass";
  let reason = "";
  let timestamp = tx.timestamp;

  let srcAddress = tx.srcAcc;
  let tgtAddress = tx.tgtAcc;
  let amount = tx.amount;
  let type = tx.type;
  let sign = tx.sign;

  if (sign && typeof sign.owner !== "string") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"sign.owner" must be a string.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (sign && typeof sign.sig !== "string") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"sign.sig" must be a string.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (typeof type !== "string") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"type" must be a string.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (srcAddress && typeof srcAddress !== "string") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"srcAddress" must be a string.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (tgtAddress && typeof tgtAddress !== "string") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"tgtAddress" must be a string.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (amount && typeof amount !== "number") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"amount" must be a number.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  if (typeof timestamp !== "number") {
    result = "fail";
    reason = '"timestamp" must be a number.';
    throw new Error(reason);
  }

  return {
    result,
    reason,
    timestamp
  };

}
```

  Although validation happens in the `validate` function, this does not mean all the validation should happen inside `validate`.
  Ideally, this function would be used only to validate incoming transactions. DApp developers may decide to perform other types of validation in the [apply](./apply) function instead. This is due to major sharding implications and restrictions. All you can do is check the transaction fields because the data may not even exist on the node yet.  Also, checking data is slow and we want a fast check to throw out poorly-formatted transactions. The last reason is that we must have a queue to support partial ordering of transactions for consensus. Even if a node had the data, it would be unsafe to read it prematurely.
