# setGlobal

`setGlobal` is a method that submits a special transaction to the network that will modify global variables that are meant to be accessible by all nodes. The `setGlobal` method takes 4 parameters:

1. `address` is a `string` that represents the address of the global account
2. `value` is the transaction object that will be submitted to the network
3. `when` is the time the transaction should be applied to the network
4. `source` is the account that originated the transaction

## Why is this important?

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" type="warning">

`setGlobal` was a method we decided to add to Shardus when we found the need for global variables. [Liberdus](https://liberdus.com) required global variables that we were able to add by introducing the `setGlobal` method. It works by submitting a transaction with a special `global` flag that aims to eventually get applied to every shard in the network. Since normal accounts are only stored in a single shard, it defeated the purpose of scalability since the global variables needed to be accessed frequently by every node. Shown below is an example of the `tally` transaction for scoring the votes for all the proposal submissions to change the network parameters.

function apply(tx, wrappedStates) {
    switch (tx.type) {
        case 'tally': {

            const issue: IssueAccount = wrappedStates[tx.issue].data
            const margin = 100 / (2 * (issue.proposalCount + 1)) / 100

            const defaultProposal: ProposalAccount = wrappedStates[crypto.hash(`issue-${issue.number}-proposal-1`)].data

> This transaction works by grabbing all the proposal accounts from the most recent `issue` account and finding the account with the most votes. If the proposal with the most votes doesn't beat 2nd place by a margin of `100 / (2 * (proposalCount + 1)) / 100` votes, then the default proposal or "no change" will be applied. We also create the next window time frames for all the network phases within the next voting cycle.
